    Add class implementation to store distance matrices. A distance matrix should be read from a .dist file and be capable of returning the
    distance stored for two entries. Catch cases in which a distance is requested, but not stored for two entries. You may want to use
    Java's Map data structures for the implementation. Feel free to use your implementation of the ScoringMatrix class from Assignment 04.
